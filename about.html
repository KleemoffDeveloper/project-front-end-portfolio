            <p>
                This project is apart of my wider collection that I've created while enrolled in <a href="https://pursuit.org" target="_blank">Pursuit</a>. 
                It's a funny story because I don't even watch Rick & Morty, I just like the idea of it because I know it has to do with space and time travel.
                Anyways, I hope this website at least looks cool even though it has a lack of function (since I am finishing this project <b>LATE</b>)... 
                Since this is the "About" section, why don't I talk about why I'm submitting this project late?
            </p>

            <h1>
                Why I Finished Late
            </h1>
            <p>
                I kind of over-estimated the amount of work it would take to finish this website so I tried helping my other Fellows 
                (classmates in <a href="https://pursuit.org" target="_blank">Pursuit</a>). The plan was to finish this in just a few hours before class on the day it was due.
                Well... I didn't finish LOL! It's kind of good that I didn't finish then because now I have this cool story to share in my "About" section.
                Thanks for reading!
            </p>
